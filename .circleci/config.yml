### It's a good practice to keep your commands at the top of the config file. In this project, you'll need at least 2 commands:

# commands:
#   destroy-environment:
#     description: Destroy backend and frontend cloudformation stacks given a workflow ID.
#     ...

#   revert-migration:
#     description: Revert the last migration if successfully run in the current workflow.
#     ...

jobs:
  build-frontend:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: pwd
      - run: node -v
      - run: |
          cd frontend
          npm run build

#  build-frontend:

#  test-frontend:

#  est-backend:

#  can-frontend:

#  scan-backend:

#  deploy-infrastructure:

#  configure-infrastructure:

#  run-migrations:

#  deploy-frontend:

#  deploy-backend:  

#  smoke-test:

#  cloudfront-update:

workflows:
